# Memory Helper
Ebbinghaus memory method helper

I need a todo list to make my daily review plan. But Mircosoft ToDo can only do planning, not repeat and statistics for the same task. So I wrote a todo application using the logic of M$ ToDo as a template to make my review plans.

**The functions are as follow:**

- Add type or subjects
- Add tasks with different types
- Add plans to review tasks
- Just show today's and expired plans
- Record the number of task review and overdue, record the review time and stage

**Features not yet supported:**

Time is tight, some non-urgent functions can only be realized in the future. So:

- Edit or delete types, tasks or plans
- Multi-Language
- Any settings function
